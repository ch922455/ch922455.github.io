I moved to Heriot-Watt University (HWU)
in beautiful Edinburgh, Scotland, effective August 16, 2022.

This website is being updated to
reflect the transitional state between Vanderbilt and HWU.
My students remain at VU. We are hiring postdocs and students at HWU in the 
near future. Expect to see links to those opportunities soon! Thanks!
